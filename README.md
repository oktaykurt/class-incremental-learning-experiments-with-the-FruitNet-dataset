# Class-Incremental-Learning-Experiments-with-the-FruitNet-Dataset
Class-IncrementalLearning(Class-IL)isa branch of continual learning focused on sequentially adding new classes (tasks) into a single classification model. The critical challenge in Class-IL is catastrophic forgettingâ€”the model often loses performance on pre- viously learned classes when trained on new ones.
